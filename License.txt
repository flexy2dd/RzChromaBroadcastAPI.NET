BETA DISCLAIMER. THE FOLLOWING SECTION SHALL APPLY IF THE SOFTWARE IS LABELED
OR OTHERWISE INDICATED AS BETA SOFTWARE:
BETA SOFTWARE MAY CONTAIN PROGRAMMING ERRORS, BUGS OR OTHER DEFECTS. A

Indemnification. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Razer from all liabilities, claims
and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) that arise from or in connection with your breach of this
Agreement or your use or misuse of the Software. Razer reserves the right, at its own expense, to

Applicable Law. You agree that this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made and accepted
in the State of California, and any dispute arising hereunder shall be resolved in accordance with the
law of California. Subject to the section “Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration; Class Action Waiver”,
you agree that any claim asserted in any legal proceeding by you against us shall be exclusively

Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to attorneys’ fees and expenses.
Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration; Class Action Waiver.
a. Notice. In the event of any dispute or claim relating to the Software or this Agreement, you or
Razer shall give the other party a notice of dispute listing the complaining party’s name,
address and contact information, and summarizing the facts and the relief requested. You
shall send notices of dispute to us at support-us@razersupport.com and insert ‘Razer
Software Dispute’ in the subject header of the email. We will send notices of dispute to you to
your address if we have it, and otherwise to your email address. Each party shall make
reasonable, good faith efforts to resolve any dispute or claim within 60 days from the date the
notice of dispute is sent.
b. Binding Arbitration and exceptions; Opt-Out; Nature of Arbitration. If we are unable to reach a
mutually satisfactory resolution within 60 days of the date of notice of dispute, then we shall
proceed to arbitration, except arbitration shall not be used and the parties may address their
dispute in court where (i) there is an intellectual property dispute such as a claim of
infringement or other violation of intellectual property rights; (ii) small claims court
requirements are satisfied; or (iii) applicable law prohibits arbitration. In addition, at any time
within 60 days of the Effective Date, you may opt out of arbitration by sending us a written, 
postage paid notice of opt-out with your name, user name, email address and mailing address
at: 201 Third Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. You may also bring your
dispute or claim to the attention of any applicable Federal, State or local government agency
that has authority by law to seek a remedy from us for you.
Arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator instead of before a court or jury.
Arbitration is less formal and requires more limited discovery than a court proceeding.
EXCEPT AS PROVIDED ABOVE, YOU AND RAZER AGREE TO RESOLVE IN BINDING
ARBITRATION ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS RELATED TO AND/OR ARISING FROM THE
SOFTWARE AND/OR THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL THEORY ON
WHICH THE DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARE BASED. YOU UNDERSTAND AND
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND TO
HAVE A TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.
c. Arbitration Procedure and Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) shall apply to the
arbitration, which shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”)
under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and where applicable, the Supplementary Procedures
for Consumer-Related Disputes. See www.adr.org for more information. The arbitration may
be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone or in person in the county
where you live or in San Francisco, California. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final,
except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties
may enforce the arbitrator’s award.
d. Class Action Waiver. PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE OR ARBITRATE ANY
DISPUTE SHALL BE BROUGHT SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. NEITHER YOU NOR
RAZER SHALL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS OR
REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION OR IN ANY OTHER
PROCEEDING IN WHICH A PARTY ACTS IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. NO
ARBITRATION SHALL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN
CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES. AN ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR
OF AN INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND NOT IN FAVOR OF ANY CLASS.
General. If any term herein is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then such term (in so far as it is
invalid or unenforceable) shall be given no effect and deemed to be excluded without invalidating any
of the remaining terms. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding with respect to the use of
the Software. Razer reserves the right to amend this Agreement at any time without notice.
